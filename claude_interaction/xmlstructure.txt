I wish to read from an XML text file that contains historical prices for a number of securities.
The file has an XML structure and the following tags are of interest to me:

<client>
    <securities>
        <security>
            <name>Security Name</name>
            <currencyCode>Currency Code</currencyCode>
            <isin>ISIN Code</isin>
            <tickerSymbol>Ticker Symbol</tickerSymbol>
            <prices>
                <price t="YYYY-MM-DD" v="ddddddddddd"/>
            </prices>
            <updatedAt>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.uuuuuuZ</updatedAt>
        </security>
    </securities>
</client>

The file is named "portfolio.xml" and within the <securities></securities> tag there will be one or more 
<security></security> tags each containing information about a given security.

Please generate a Go program that will read the contents of this file that are of interest to me
into a suitable Go structure.
